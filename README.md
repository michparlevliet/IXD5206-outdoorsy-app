# OutDoorsy App Prototype

This is a static prototype for the Outdoorsy App profile page, created in collaboration with students from Web Development, Interaction Design, and Content Strategy programs at Humber College.

The Outdoorsy App aims to connect people living in urban areas with green spaces while also encouraging fitness and community activities. The prototype simulates the profile page experience on the app, where users can browse their saved activities and add goals to their profile.

This static web-page is intended for mobile use and was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You can view the prototype [here](https://michparlevliet.github.io/IXD5206-outdoorsy-app/).
